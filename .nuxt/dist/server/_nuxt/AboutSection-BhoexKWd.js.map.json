I’m hungry for feedback and keep a high bar—not for perfection’s sake, but to earn trust through clarity, reliability, and follow-through. I believe no one is a know-it-all, so I learn by doing: pick things up fast on the job, ship in small steps, measure what matters, write things down, and share learnings. I favor simple solutions that scale and own outcomes, aiming to leave teams and code a little better than I found them. Outside work, I keep a competitive streak in athletics—distance running in the summer, snowboarding in the winter—and unwind by cooking for friends; those habits keep me curious, disciplined, and energized for the next challenge.</span>\n  </div>\n</section>\n\n</template>\n\n<script setup>\n</script>\n<style scoped>\n.about-copy p { color: var(--text-1); margin-left:30px; margin-right:30px; }\n.about .about-copy { margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.8; font-size: 18px; }\n.about{ margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 40px; }\nh2 { margin-top:15px; margin-bottom: 15px; }\n</style>"],"version":3}
