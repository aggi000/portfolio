  <h2>About me</h2>
  <div class="about-copy">
    <span><strong>I’m Agrim.</strong> —driven to turn messy, ambiguous problems into things people actually use. I’m hungry for feedback and keep a high bar—not for perfection’s sake, but to earn trust through clarity, reliability, and follow-through. I believe no one is a know-it-all, so I learn by doing: pick things up fast on the job, ship in small steps, measure what matters, write things down, and share learnings. I favor simple solutions that scale and own outcomes, aiming to leave teams and code a little better than I found them. Outside work, I keep a competitive streak in athletics—distance running in the summer, snowboarding in the winter—and unwind by cooking for friends; those habits keep me curious, disciplined, and energized for the next challenge.</span>
