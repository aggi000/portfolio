  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p class="about-intro"><strong>Iâ€™m Agrim.</strong> I like turning challenging, ambiguous problems into things people actually use.</p>
  <ul class="about-points">
    <li>Invite feedback early, keep a high bar, and earn trust with clarity, reliability, and follow-through.</li>
    <li>Learn by doing. No one knows it all; I pick things up fast on the job.</li>
    <li>Ship in small steps and let real usage guide the next iteration.</li>
    <li>Measure what matters, write things down, and share learnings.</li>
    <li>Prefer simple solutions that scale over clever ones.</li>
    <li>Own outcomes end-to-end; leave teams and code better than I found them.</li>
    <li>Outside work: distance running, snowboarding, and cooking for friends. These habits keep me curious, disciplined, and energized.</li>
