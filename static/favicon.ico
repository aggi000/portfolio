The file /agrim_portfolio/agrim_portfolio/static/favicon.ico is intended to be a favicon file, which is typically a binary image file. Since I cannot generate binary files directly, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

Please ensure that the favicon.ico file is placed in the /static directory of your project.
